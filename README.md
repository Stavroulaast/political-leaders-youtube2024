The main goal of this study is to understand how elected political leaders (members of the Hellenic Parliament) in Greece utilize their YouTube channels and what kind of
content upload in 2023. Additionally, this study helps understand how digital tools like programming and AI models like ChatGTP can assist new media research.

It is crucial to see **how political engagement happens online in Greece** and **how politicians use YouTube** by getting data-driven insights.
The sampling frame encompasses the leaders of nine political parties elected in the Hellenic Parliament. The data collected on 31 January 2024.

The study examined nine channels belonging to Androulakis Nikos (PASOK), Mitsotakis Kyriakos (Nea
Dimokratia), Kasselakis Stefanos (SYRIZA), Haritsis Alexandros (Nea Aristera), Stigas Vasileios
(Spartiates), Dimitrios Natsios (NIKI), Velopoulos Kyriakos (Elliniki Lysi), Konstantopoulou Zoe (Pleusi
Eleftherias), and Koutsoumpas Dimitris (KKE). For leaders such as Konstantopoulou Zoe (Pleusi Eleftherias),
Stigas Vasileios (Spartiates), Koutsoumpas Dimitris (KKE), and Dimitrios Natsios (NIKI), the channels of
their respective parties were analyzed, as these leaders do not maintain distinct personal online preferences on
YouTube separate from their parties.
